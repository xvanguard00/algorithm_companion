Bubble Sort is the simplest sorting algorithm that works by repeatedly swapping the adjacent elements if they are in the wrong order.\n
This algorithm is not suitable for large data sets as its average and worst case time complexity is quite high.\n
First Iteration (Compare and Swap)\n
1. Starting from the first index, compare the first and the second elements.\n
2. If the first element is greater than the second element, they are swapped.\n
3. Now, compare the second and the third elements. Swap them if they are not in order.\n
4. The above process goes on until the last element.\n
If there are more iterations to be done, steps 1 to 4 are repeating.\n

<string name="quicksortData">
Quicksort is a Divide and Conquer algorithm\n
It picks an element as pivot and partitions the array around the pivot\n
There are variants with different pivots for this algorithm, to name a few\n
First element as pivot\n
Last element as pivot\n
Random element as pivot\n
Middle as pivot\n
The key process to quicksort is its partitioning\n
The target of partition is to give an array and x as pivot\n
to put x at the correct position, and every element smaller than x to the left\n
and all the bigger elements bigger than x to the right\n
This happens in linear time\n
</string>
<string name="insertionsortData">
Insertion sort is a simple sorting algorithm.\n
The array is virtually split into a sorted and an unsorted part.\n
Values from the unsorted part are picked and placed at the correct position in the sorted part.\n
